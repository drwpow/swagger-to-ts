       * For bank accounts, possible values are `new`, `validated`, `verified`, `verification_failed`, or `errored`. A bank account that hasn't had any activity or validation performed is `new`. If Stripe can determine that the bank account exists, its status will be `validated`. Note that there often isn’t enough information to know (e.g., for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always run. If customer bank account verification has succeeded, the bank account status will be `verified`. If the verification failed for any reason, such as microdeposit failure, the status will be `verification_failed`. If a transfer sent to this bank account fails, we'll set the status to `errored` and will not continue to send transfers until the bank details are updated.
       *
       * For external accounts, possible values are `new` and `errored`. Validations aren't run against external accounts because they're only used for payouts. This means the other statuses don't apply. If a transfer fails, the status is set to `errored` and transfers are stopped until account details are updated.

     * Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in

     * object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded`
     * event; and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an
     * `invoice.payment_failed` event. Note that many API requests may cause multiple
     * events to be created. For example, if you create a new subscription for a
     * customer, you will receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a
     * `charge.succeeded` event.
     *
     * Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The state of that
     * resource at the time of the change is embedded in the event's data field. For
     * example, a `charge.succeeded` event will contain a charge, and an
     * `invoice.payment_failed` event will contain an invoice.
     *
     * As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an
     * [individual event](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_events)
     * from the API. We also have a separate
     * [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the
     * `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. Webhooks are managed
     * in your
     * [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks'),
     * and our [Using Webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) guide will help you get set up.
     *
     * When using [Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect), you can also receive notifications of
     * events that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there will be an
     * additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.

     *
     * If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
     * [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic'),
     * Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
     * emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.

     * A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
     * For example, you could use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
     * Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.
     *
     * Create a SetupIntent as soon as you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
     * Do not maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents as they may no longer be valid.
     * The SetupIntent then transitions through multiple [statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
     * you through the setup process.
     *
     * Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
     * For example, cardholders in [certain regions](/guides/strong-customer-authentication) may need to be run through
     * [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) at the time of payment method collection
     * in order to streamline later [off-session payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/setup-intents).
     * If the SetupIntent is used with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer), upon success,
     * it will automatically attach the resulting payment method to that Customer.
     * We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
     * PaymentIntents to save payment methods in order to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.
     *
     * By using SetupIntents, you ensure that your customers experience the minimum set of required friction,
     * even as regulations change over time.
     *
